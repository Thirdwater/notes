= Chess

== Order

. Checkmates
. Avoid checkmates
. The rest is heuristics (e.g. material, position, activity)

Only the first 2 are logical while the rest is not until we have a perfect agent.

== General

* Find time-efficient moves
** Utilise free tempos (e.g. zwischenzug)
** Go for multiple objectives (e.g. double attacks)
*** Better if opponent's reply can't cover all the objectives
* Utilise existing connections and lost connections
** Defender leaving
** Broken pins

== Early Game

* Develop pieces
* Open development options (e.g. pushing pawns for bishops)
* Open castling options (e.g. develop minor pieces)
* Limit opponent options
** Centre hold
** a3/a6 and h3/h6 pawns blocking the knight or bishop
** Blocking pawn pushes
* Limit opponent tempos
** Remove checks with development (e.g. castling to safety)
** Remove captures with development
* Adding defenders
* Setting up posts
** Bishops on key diagonals
** Knights on outposts

== Middle Game

* Targeting already limited pieces (e.g. forcing backward moves/less active squares)
* Targeting pieces around/opening up lines toward the enemy king
* Limit opponent's control over key areas
