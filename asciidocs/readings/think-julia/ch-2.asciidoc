= Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, and Statements

== Exercise 2-1

Consider:

[source, julia, linenums, options="nowrap"]
----
5
x = 5
x + 1
----

* The REPL would display `5`, `5`, and `6` after each statements respectively.
* The script would not display anything.
* To get the same output from the script, consider:
+
[source, julia, linenums, options="nowrap"]
----
println(5)
x = 5
println(x)
println(x + 1)
----

== Exercise 2-2

. `42 = n` results in `invalid assignment location` error on the value `42`.

. `x = y = 1` is valid and results in both `x` and `y` referring to the value `1`.

. Semicolon delimits expressions and statements and is valid.
  In the REPL, semicolons will also suppress the output from printing,
  the preceding expression/statement will still be evaluated/executed.
+
[source, julia, linenums, options="nowrap"]
----
x = 1; y = 2;  # no REPL output
x  # outputs 1
y  # outputs 2
----

. Putting a period at the end of a statement results in syntax error.
+
But when the last expression is still valid after adding the period,
we will simply get different semantic based on what the period does to the expression
(e.g. `x = 5.` resulting in `x` being a float instead of integer).

. Given numerical variables `x` and `y`, `x y` results in a syntax error
  and `xy` is just another identifier.
+
However, `5x` is valid in Julia and works as in maths with multiplication precedence
(e.g. `x = 5; 2x^2` results in 50 and not 100).
Note that this is unambiguous since variables cannot start with a number.

== Exercise 2-3

. The volume of a sphere with radius 5 is `(4/3)Ï€ * 5^3 ~ 523.6`.

. For the price of $24.95 with 40% discount,
  each item would cost `24.95 * 0.6 = $14.97`.
+
For $3, $0.75 shipping costs for the first and subsequent items respectively,
the total shipping cost for 60 items would be `3 + (0.75 * 59) = $47.25`.
+
So the total cost would be `(14.97 * 60) + 47.25 = $945.45`.

. For 8 minutes and 15 seconds per mile pace, each mile will take `(8 * 60) + 15 = 495` seconds.
+
For 7 minutes and 12 seconds per mile pace, each mile will take `(7 * 60) + 12 = 432` seconds.
+
So 2 miles at the slower pace takes `495 * 2 = 990` seconds,
and 3 miles at the faster pace takes `432 * 3 = 1296` seconds.
+
So the whole trip takes `990 + 1296 = 2286` seconds.
+
The starting time is `((6 * 60) + 52) * 60 = 24720` seconds,
so the final time is `24720 + 2286 = 27006` seconds
which is `div(27006, 60 * 60) = 7` hours and `rem(27006, 60 * 60) = 1806` minutes.
Now 1806 minutes is `div(1806, 60) = 30` minutes and `rem(1806, 60) = 6` seconds.
+
So the final time is 7:30:06 am.
